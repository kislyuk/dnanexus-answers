                <strong>Gold badges</strong> are rare. You'll have to not only participate but be skilled and knowledgeable
                to earn these. They're something of an accomplishment!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Silver badges</strong> are earned for longer term goals. Silver badges are uncommon, but
                definitely attainable if you're interested enough.

                <strong>Bronze badges</strong> are earned for basic use of the DNAnexus Answers site; they are relatively
                easy to earn.
